	* Re-added tkinactive, now at version 0.4 which checks the
	  OS version and fails to load if the Win32 API is not
	  support SendInput() function. This should allow tclWinidle
	  to load on such platforms (Win9x, WinNT < SP 3.0).

	* Pack version bumped to r2.

	  * Memchan, vfs -- provide for handling of JISP archives.
	  License files updated.

	* Trf 2.1p2 built from sources to work with zlib from this package.

	* "Info after" file is now installed as a piece of documentation
	  and entitled "Quick Tips" in the icons folder.


11-10-2007  Konstantin Khomoutov <flatworm@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added missing md4 and des packages to tcllib (this should
	  make NTLM proxy auth to start working).

	  Tcllib so that some unnecessery files were wiped out.

	* Marked as "rev.2".
