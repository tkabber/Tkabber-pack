* If you haven't used Tkabber before, please read its "Quick Help"
  provided in the "Help" submenu of the Tkabber's main menu. It contains
  description of the most frequently used keyboard shortcuts.

* Tkabber-Pack contains the set of standard plugins for Tkabber.

  To enable a plugin navigate to the "Services" main menu entry
  and activate "Add/remove Plugins" item. You will be presented
  with a list of available standard plugins and their short
  descriptions. Each plugin has a checkbox attached to its name.
  Check the plugins you want to install, uncheck those you want
  to uninstall, then press "Apply changes". Restart Tkabber for
  the changes to take effect.

  The other way to install a plugin is to do this manually.
  All standard plugins can be found in the "Plugins" subdirectory
  of the directory in which Tkabber-Pack was just installed.
  You can open it using the "Open Plugins Folder" item of the
  Tkabber's start menu. To manually install a plugin copy its
  directory (as a whole! not files from it) under the
  %APPDATA%\Tkabber\plugins directory.
  To disable plugin, remove that plugin directory.
  %APPDATA% is your "application data" special system folder.
  On Windows XP it's usually
  "C:\Program Files\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data"
  where USERNAME is the login name you're using.

* If you have any problems with Tkabber, at first read the
  "Installation and operation guide" available at the
  Tkabber's Start menu folder.
